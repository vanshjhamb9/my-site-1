I want to build a Next.js website that replicates and improves upon the design of https://kodytechnolab.com with modern, interactive UI and fluid animations.

Use Tailwind CSS for styling, and Framer Motion or CSS transitions for animations. The app should be fully responsive and mobile-friendly.

‚úÖ Design Requirements:
Color Palette:

Background: #111827 (dark grey)

Primary Accent: #FFD102 (bright yellow)

Text: White (#FFFFFF), Light grey for secondary text

Use Inter, or other modern sans-serif font

Header (Navbar):

Sticky header with transparent background initially, becomes solid on scroll

Includes logo on left and nav links on right with hover underline animation

Hero Section:

Full-screen hero with animated text using Framer Motion

Subheading + CTA buttons ("Get in Touch", "Explore More")

Include a Lottie or SVG illustration on the right

Services Section:

3-6 card components with icon, service title, and short description

On hover: card elevation + color change animation

About Section:

Side-by-side layout: text on one side, image/illustration on the other

Use scroll animations (e.g. fade in from left/right)

Case Studies / Projects Section:

Grid layout with images, project title, and hover overlay animation

Testimonials Section:

Carousel/slider of 3+ testimonials with client avatar, name, and feedback

Use smooth slide animation and responsive layout
